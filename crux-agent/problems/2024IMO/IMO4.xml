Problem 4. Let ABC be a triangle with AB < AC < BC. Let the incentre and incircle of triangle
ABC be I and ω, respectively. Let X be the point on line BC different from C such that the line
through X parallel to AC is tangent to ω. Similarly, let Y be the point on line BC different from
B such that the line through Y parallel to AB is tangent to ω. Let AI intersect the circumcircle of
triangle ABC again at P ̸= A. Let K and L be the midpoints of AC and AB, respectively.
Prove that ∠KIL + ∠Y P X = 180◦
