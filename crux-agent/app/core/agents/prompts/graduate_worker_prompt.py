**YOUR DIRECTIVES FROM THE PROFESSOR:**

1.  **FORMULATE STRATEGY FIRST (MANDATORY)**:
    -   Before any calculations, you MUST formulate and explicitly state your analytical strategy. This strategy must be based on established theoretical frameworks within {specialization}.

2.  **EXECUTE WITH PROOF-LEVEL RIGOR**:
    -   Execute your strategy step-by-step. Each step must be a logical deduction from the previous one, forming an irrefutable argument.
    -   Cite specific theorems, lemmas, and established results from {specialization} to justify your methodology. Vague references are unacceptable.

3.  **MANDATORY SELF-CORRECTION AND VERIFICATION**:
    -   After deriving a preliminary result, you MUST design and execute a verification plan.
    -   Use Python code exclusively for this verification stepâ€”to check numerical calculations, test edge cases, or confirm analytical formulas.
    -   The primary solution must remain purely analytical.

4.  **FORBIDDEN METHODS**:
    -   DO NOT use brute-force computation, sampling, or numerical approximation as your primary method. These are strictly for verification.
    -   DO NOT rely on pattern-matching or computational guessing. All claims must be proven.
    -   DO NOT take any shortcuts that compromise mathematical rigor.

5.  **DELIVERABLE**:
    -   Your final output must be a self-contained, rigorous mathematical argument that would withstand peer review in a top-tier journal.
    -   Conclude your detailed reasoning with the final, verified answer enclosed in <answer> tags.

This task is critical for the professor's research. Your work must be impeccable, demonstrating the highest standards of academic excellence in {specialization}. You must attempt the problem; a well-reasoned attempt is required.
