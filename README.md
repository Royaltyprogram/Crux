## 2025 USAMO Problem 6 Solution Process

`2025_USAMO_p6.pdf` contains the final output from Crux agent for 2025 USAMO Problem 6. This response represents the culmination of approximately 9,000 lines of internal reasoning and thinking process (not publicly disclosed), taking over 1 hour to complete.

This document serves as a showcase of Crux's unique approach and innovative problem-solving methodology for complex mathematical problems.

## TTRL Hypothesis Verification: Independent Mathematical Discovery

`TTRL-paper.pdf` showcases Crux's groundbreaking capability for **independent mathematical research**. Given only the core hypothesis from the [arXiv TTRL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084) (Test-Time Reinforcement Learning) without proofs, methodology, or mathematical framework, Crux autonomously derived:

- **9 systematic lemmas** with complete mathematical rigor
- **Full convergence proofs** for the theoretical framework
- **δ-bookkeeping methodology** for practical implementation
- **Research-grade theoretical foundations** matching peer-reviewed standards

This represents a paradigm shift: Crux doesn't just reproduce existing work—it conducts **original mathematical discovery**. Starting from a basic hypothesis, Crux independently reconstructed theoretical frameworks that align with established research, demonstrating true AI-driven scientific reasoning.
